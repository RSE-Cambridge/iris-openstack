# IRIS OpenStack @ Cambridge University

The [Cambirdge University](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/) IRIS OpenStack deployment is part of the [Cumulus](https://www.top500.org/system/179577) supercomputer.

For more details please contact John Taylor, StackHPC.

## Onboarding for 2019/2020

Soon we hope to enable external access to OpenStack APIs, with a federated login.

## Onboarding for 2018/2019

Once invited to access the system, please request an AlaSKA account via:
(https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/external-application)[https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/external-application]

This will setup ssh access to: `alaska-gate.vss.cloud.cam.ac.uk`

### Setting up SOCKS proxy to access Cumulus OpenStack.

At the moment Cumulus OpenStack is isolated in the AlaSKA network.

TODO: add details on how to access the OpenStack deployment.
